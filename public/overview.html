							<h1>Our Mission</h1>
							<p style="margin-right: 150px">Our mission at Polycards presented by Team Euclid is to provide and easy, free and annonymous way for students to study at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. As a student driven project, we do not have any goals of monetization, but are instead focussing on the project as a learning experience for ourselves while doing our best to help out our fellow student. Because of this, as a team, we inheritely value your privacy and wallet, never asking you to make an account and never charging a single cent to use our product. This project is created entirely by students, for students and we plan to make that our top priority.</p>
